# Welcome to the 'mico' theme!

The mico theme for Jekyll is a clean, minimalist, and comfy theme for those seeking a simplistic yet familiar aesthetic. Similar to older styles of themes present in the mid-2010's, mico is meant to allude to an earlier time on the Internet, while retaining the modern comforts of today. Due to its basic design, mico is automatically suited to screens of any and all sizes, scaling comfortably without losing any content.

mico was built with GitHub Pages in mind, being able to be immediately deployed with very little configuration and elbow grease.

mico is licensed under the MIT license and is available to all for free. I encourage those who need a more specialized experience to [fork the original repo on GitHub](https://github.com/zfett/mico) and configure to their heart's content!
